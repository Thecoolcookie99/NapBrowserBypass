# NapBrowserBypass
This repository is to show how bad and useless the naplan browser is, I don't endorse cheating with this. Please do not use this to cheat or violate academic integrity.

## IOS guide:
1. Open settings
2. Search "Guided Access" in the searchbar, or go to Settings > Accessibility > Guided Access and toggle it on
3. Open the Nap Locked Down Browser and triple click the home button as soon as you get in.
4. Press "Guided access", select "Start", Choose a password (You need to remember this!). Accept any dialouge that shows up.
5. When you get onto the naplan screen, triple click the home button, enter your chosen password. The guided access dialouge shows up if you did it right. Press "Quit"
6. You can now use the browser as a normal ios app!

## MacOS guide:
1. Open settings > Accessibility > Accessibility shortcut and enable all options if you havent done so
2. Open Nap Locked down browser
3. Press Command-Q to open up the admin password prompt
4. Open guided access by pressing "command + option + fn + F5 (microphone button)
5. A menu will show up. At the bottom are three buttons. Press "Keyboard shortcuts", pressing F4 (the search icon) immediatly after.

   ### This will put the app in a state, where if the tabs are moved, it will re-enter the Nap Browser if other apps are opened/selected.

7. If the naplan browser is covering up the app changer, drag the browser down and repeat steps **3** to **5**
8. Press the "**+**" button in the top right to open a new desktop. from there, you can open apps via cmd+space, the dock, or the desktop
